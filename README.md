* .NET 4.5
* Twitter Streaming API Interface

##Before You Build
==================================

Before you build you will want to sign up for a twitter account and sign up for a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">twitter api key</a>. 
This project uses the Twitter API to communicate. You will also want to authorize your twitter account to be used by your application.

#####Twitter Keys

Before you run the application for the first time you will need to sign up for the twitter developer api.
You will need to create the private.config file for the application to connect to twitter. 
The contents will need to contain the Twitter API keys (see the test project app.config).
